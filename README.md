# MIND CARE

WE LISTEN, WE CARE. WE ARE MIND-CARE.

## App Description :

- Mind Care is an app to connect people, suffering from some form of mental illness, to counsellors and other people who have suffered it before, so that they can receive genuine guidance and help.

- The app has a general forum where users can list their problems and receive tips on dealing with them from certified professionals(doctors, psychiatrists, counsellors) or others who have been through the same problem before. People can also share their experience on how they dealt with their mental unrest which motivate others that they can fight back too. Above all, each and every patient will have someone to talk to through these forums.

- Another feature incorporated in the app is the 'Mental Health Feed' on which only certified counsellors will be able to write and post articles on various topics of mental health and self care. They can also share articles from other sources in the feed. This will be very very beneficial as it provides legitimate and verified content to the users on mental health and self care.

- Finally the last feature that this app has a meditation streak tracker. Meditation is one of the most critical practice to adopt for a good mental health. The users can keep a track of their meditation journey with the help of this meditation tracker.

- Overall the UI of the app has been kept pleasant and beautiful for a better User Experience.
